Git: Tool/sw 
-which run on computer/system
-version control system
-is a tools that helps to track changes in code.
-free & open source

1. to track history of code. like adding featuring, adding button.
2. to collaborate team- means in a project,in a team so many developers are working and they are working on different feature so there work should not get overwrite. so we need sw to identify who is working on what.

GitHub: Website
-website that allows deveopers to store and manage their code using git.
-commit- changes
-two things are there: add & commit

GitHub Practical 1 - adding, commit
1. create repo
- name -> add readme file
2. commit changes
-you can add anything in readme file(edit icon to change)
-you can see changes committed or not (updates)
-you can use html tag.

Git practical 2 - setting up Git on system
1. download sw
-visual studio code
-git bash for windows
-Terminal for Mac

2. to check which version we have downloaded
- Run command git --version on git bash/terminal

3.configurinh Git- 
configuring means to which account we are going to make changes
-root directory/ primary folder ~

git config --global user.name "nehasawan"
git config --global user.email "nehasawant719@gmail.com"
git config --list

4. Clone & Status:
a)Cloning: cloning repo on our local machine

remote- on GitHub
local- laptop/pc

-we use cloning when we want to copy files from remote to local
git clone https://github.com/nehasawan/Git-Github.git

go inside folder:
cd foldername

to check all files inside folder:
ls 

to check all hiddent files store in folder
ls -a

b)status: display ths status of code
git status

-untracked: new files that gitt doesn't yet tracked
-modified: changed
-staged: files are added now u can commit
-unmodified:unchanged


5. Add & commit:
a) add: add new or unchanged files in your working directory to the git staging area.
git add "filename" - to add fresh new file
git add .\README.md - you can modify also

b)commit:
git commit -m 'done'
git status

it wont reflect on remote(github), only will reflect on local system.

6. Push Command- to push all files n modified files from local to remote(github)
git push origin main

origin means- on remote there is default repo i.e
main - its branch inside this branch we push files


------------------------------------------------------
from git
create a new repository on the command line
echo "# hth" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/nehasawan/hth.git
git push -u origin main

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/nehasawan/hth.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
